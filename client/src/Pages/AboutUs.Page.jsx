                    Welcome to <strong>Snack Track</strong>, a platform created
                    by students for students. We aim to provide a space where
                    peers can share their thoughts, experiences, and ideas while
                    building connections within the college community.

                <p className="text-md">
                    Our mission is to create a digital space that encourages
                    collaboration, learning, and fun through writing. Whether
                    it's about the latest campus event, personal experiences, or
                    simply sharing knowledge, College Connect Blog serves as the
                    go-to place for students to express themselves and connect
                    with like-minded individuals.

                <h2 className="w-full text-center my-6">Why We Started?</h2>
                <p className="text-md">
                    As college students, we wanted a place where we could freely
                    share our ideas and engage with others. We realized that
                    many students have great stories to tell, but sometimes
                    there isn't a dedicated space to share them. So, we decided
                    to build College Connect Blog as a way to bridge that gap
                    and provide a platform for communication and connection.
